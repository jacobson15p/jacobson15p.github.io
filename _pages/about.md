Hi! My name is Philip - I'm currently a third year PhD student in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences department at UC Berkeley advised by [Prof. Ming Wu](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/wu.html). Previously, I attained my bachelor's degree in Physics from Cornell University, and have also spent time at HRL Laboratories as an intern. 

My research broadly is in the area of Machine Learing/Vision. Specifically, I am interested in perception for autonomous vehicles. My current work seeks to leverage multiple data modalities (camera, LiDAR) to build systems for object detection and tracking. Ultimately, the goal of this line of research is to answer the question of how, when, and where to "fuse" representations from these different modalities in order to achieve the most robust and efficient models possible. I also have a standing interest in self-supervised learning and learning in the low-label regime, as well as hardware accelerators (particurlary photonic) for machine learning. 

Outside of lab, I enjoy being hiking, running, video games, watching sports, and exploring!
